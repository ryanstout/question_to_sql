# NLP Query

A BI tool that lets you dig into your data using natural language

# Development

All local installation is documented in:

```shell
bin/setup.sh
npm run dev
```

# Prisma

Generate the python and ts schemas with:
`prisma generate --schema prisma/schema.prisma`

# Frontend

- All route logic is very thin: business logic should be pushed into `~/lib/`, view logic should validate params, redirect, hit lib logic, and then pass props to components for rendering.
- All `~/components` should not use "top-level state"
- All `action` and `loader` exports should be thin and pass to a `~/lib/*.server` file (this is the "frontend of the backend")
- `action` and `loader` exports should do all input validation and state retrieval before passing to the `*.server` functions

# Python API

Start the server:

```shell
poetry run python python/server.py
```

Ask a question:

```shell
http POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 'question:="my question"' data_source_id:=1
```

# CLI Tools

First, we need to import the table data:

```shell
poetry run python python/import.py \
  --user-id=1 \
  --database-name=FIVETRAN_DATABASE \
  --table-limit=100 \
  --column-limit=1000 \
  --column-value-limit=1000
```

Once everything is imported, we can ask questions:

```shell
poetry run python python/answer.py \
  --data-source-id 1 \
  --question "What are the top orders of all time?"
```

# Schemas [WIP]

Place your test database in a local postgres (currenthly hardcoded to db name of witharsenal_prod_copy)

Generate the schema with:
`ts-node --require tsconfig-paths/register  --transpileOnly app/models/generate_schema.ts > prisma/test_schema.sql`
