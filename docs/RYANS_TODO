- [ ] UI to visualize schema generation
- [ ] UI to tweak the weights
- [ ] Add IS NULL
- [ ] check total values to see if we hit all values (or close < 5 maybe just add all of them?)
- [ ] Lowercase select makes for a lower case query, which we can use logprobs to construct confidence intervals on sections

# Query to Table+Col+Value Weight Ranking Network

- 1 network to weight values
  - inputs: value embedding search weights, ranker cross entropy
- 1 network to weight columns
  - inputs:
    - histogram of value weights (for all values, with shrinking buckets towards the high end)
    - column and table+column match weights
- 1 network to rank tables
  - inputs:
    - histogram of column weights (shrinking towards high end)
    - table, table+column, table+column+value embedding weights

^ Maybe merge the above to a single ranking network, but run through in values, columns, tables order to feed unknown values
