- [ ] UI to visualize schema generation
- [ ] Add IS NULL
- [ ] check total number of values to see if we hit all values for a highly weighted column with low? cardinality (or close < 5 maybe just add all of them?)
- [x] Lowercase select makes for a lower case query, which we can use logprobs to construct confidence intervals on sections
- [x] ILIKE and REGEX_ILIKE should get converted to ILIKE(LOWER({..}), "%something%"{.lower()})
- [x] Try generating mysql instead of postgres, mysql doesn't have as many extensions, might help keep things in bounds for snowflake more.
- [ ] Use ChatGPT and ChatShortFormatter schema format shorthand to recursively get the required fields for a query.
- [ ] SchemaBuilder still doesn't hit the target tokens very well
- [ ] Convert NOW's back for Snowflake to Postgres

Sql Glot Magic Fixes:

- [ ] Ambigious columns can happen when one column that gets used is present in the schema, but a column with the same name is also present in another used table. This can probably be fixed with some sqlglot magic
- [ ] Fix issue with non-aggregrate columns not being included in GROUP BY

SqlInspector:

- [x] Add ability to pull string values from IN queries
